# Earthquakes

## Task
Task was to make a simple app with two screens:
On the first screen I need to diaplay the list of all earthquakes in the given region with distinguishing of earthquakes with magnitude greater or equal to 8.0. Once user taps on any eqrthquake in the list second screen should be opened. 
On the second screen need to be a map with the location of the chosen earthquake.

## Design
The app was done using MVP pattern with some MVI influence to make it simple and testable. 

## Thirdparties
No thirdparty libs were used.

## Testing
The only piece of business logic was found in EarthquakeListPresenter so it was covered with unit tests. I don't have time to cover the app with UI tests.

## Time
It took me about 4-5 hours to implement this task so please don't expect much from it.
